# Get Case Thread Token Flow Action
Salesforce Email To Case Lightning Threading Token

Allows for passing the case id and returning the thread token.

Used when you must stamp the thread token onto the case record itself, in a screen flow, list view, report, etc for interactivity with your users.

Simply add your own custom text field (255) to the case object, assign to layout, grant permissions, and connect it to a flow on case to assign the token field.
